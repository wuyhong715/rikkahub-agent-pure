 * [Mutex] - with two differences that follow from what embeddings are for:
 *
 *  * [embed] is a suspend call that takes the lock for one text and returns, rather than
 *    holding it for a token stream. An index build embeds hundreds of chunks; serialising
 *    them is required (llama_context is not thread-safe) but there is no cancellation flag to
 *    expose, because each call is short enough that finishing it is cheaper than interrupting.
 *  * there is no prompt, template or sampler anywhere - an embedding model has one input and
 *    one output, and anything shaped like a chat would be a lie about what is happening.
