/**
 * The OpenAI-compatible `/embeddings` shape, in both directions.
 *
 * Kept apart from the call - [EmbeddingsAPI] does the socket, this does the bytes - and free of
 * anything Android, because this is the half that fails *silently*: a request the provider quietly
 * reshapes, or a response whose vectors come back in a different order than they were asked for,
 * produces an index that is wrong rather than one that errors. Everything else about a cloud
 * embedding - which key, which window, which model the user meant - is decided above this file;
 * what is decided here is the wire format, and it has a test.
