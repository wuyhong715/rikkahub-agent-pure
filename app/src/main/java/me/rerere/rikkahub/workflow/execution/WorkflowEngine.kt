/**
 * Phase 12 — workflow execution engine. The single entry point for any workflow fire.
 *
 * Lifecycle of a fire (matches `headless = true` semantics from cron jobs):
 *  1. Lookup workflow + verify enabled.
 *  2. Cooldown check — `lastRunAtMs + cooldownSeconds` against now.
 *  3. Daily-cap check — counted fires (SUCCESS+FAILED) for today's local date.
 *  4. Build [WorkflowContext] — lazy on location for sunset/sunrise conditions.
 *  5. Evaluate conditions; AND-combined.
 *  6. Resolve assistant + tool list. Workflows are app-global, but actions still need a
 *     tool surface to execute against — we use the first assistant with the Workflows
 *     toggle on (the toggle gates *authoring*; runtime fallback is reasonable).
 *  7. Execute action sequence via [DirectModeActionRunner] — every action HARDLINE-checked.
 *  8. Persist run row, projected last-run state, daily counter, trim history.
 *
 * Concurrency: per-workflow mutex so two near-simultaneous fires (e.g. WiFi flicker) can't
 * race on the daily counter. Cross-workflow execution stays parallel.
 *
 * Approval semantics: HARDLINE applies in workflow context. Tool factories that set
 * `needsApproval = { true }` would normally pop a prompt — workflows are headless and the
 * pre-authorisation is the workflow_create approval the user already granted. So the
 * action runner just calls the tool's [Tool.execute] directly. This matches scheduled-jobs
 * direct-mode behavior.
 *
 * The `Workflows` per-assistant toggle gates the seven `workflow_*` LLM tools, NOT the
 * trigger pipeline. A workflow that's been authored stays armed regardless of which
 * assistant the user is currently chatting with. Trigger dispatch is gated by the
 * workflow's own `enabled` flag.
