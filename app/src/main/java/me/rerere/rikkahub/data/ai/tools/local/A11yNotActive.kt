/**
 * The JSON envelope every screen-automation tool returns when the AccessibilityService is not
 * connected. Pure (kotlinx-serialization only) so it is unit-testable on the JVM without an
 * Android context; [AccessibilityServiceHandle] supplies the one OS fact it needs.
 *
 * The two causes look identical to a tool but need completely different advice, so
 * [enabledInSettings] splits them:
 * - `false` ⇒ the service is not (or no longer) enabled at all: point at the system toggle.
 * - `true`  ⇒ the toggle IS on but the service is not bound. On aggressive OEM ROMs
 *   (Vivo/Xiaomi/Huawei) that is the signature of "the app was killed in the background and
 *   the service was dropped with it", so also hand over the keep-alive steps and the one-tap
 *   repair instead of telling the user to redo a toggle that is already on.
