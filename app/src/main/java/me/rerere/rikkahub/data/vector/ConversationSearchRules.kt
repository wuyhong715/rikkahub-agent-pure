/**
 * What history search is allowed to index, and how much of it one round may read.
 *
 * The index is over **one message per document**, which is the granularity the keyword index it
 * replaces already used: a hit should point at something a person can open, not at "somewhere in
 * this conversation". Two consequences worth stating, because they are load- bearing:
 *
 *  - a document key carries the conversation as well as the message (`<conversationId>|<messageId>`)
 *    so a hit can be resolved back to a title and a date without a second index, and so a sync
 *    limited to one conversation can tell its own keys from everyone else's;
 *  - messages are read from the JSON blob a conversation stores, so the round is planned from
 *    *metadata* (ids and lengths) and only the chosen messages are read in full. That is what keeps
 *    a walk over an entire history cheap: the memory a round holds is proportional to the budget,
 *    not to the history.
