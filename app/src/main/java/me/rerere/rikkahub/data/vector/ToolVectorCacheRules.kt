/**
 * P3-02 — the cache identity of one tool's vector.
 *
 * A tool's vector is only reusable while three things hold: the same **model** produced it (two
 * models' vectors live in different spaces, so comparing them is meaningless rather than merely
 * inaccurate), the same **name** addresses it, and the same **text** was embedded (an MCP server
 * can rewrite a tool's description between sessions, and a stale vector would quietly keep
 * ranking the old wording).
 *
 * Keying by name rather than by text keeps the cache one-vector-per-tool; keying by text would
 * leak the previous wording for every edit. The text fingerprint rides along in the value instead,
 * which is what lets [lookup] answer "is this entry's vector still the vector for *this* text?".
 *
 * Pure — no coroutines, no model, no files — so the cache contract is unit-testable on a bare JVM
 * (`ToolVectorCacheRulesTest`), while the embedding and the concurrency live in [ToolVectorIndex].
