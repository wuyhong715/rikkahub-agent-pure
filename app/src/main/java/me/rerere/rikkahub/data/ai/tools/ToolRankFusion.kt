/**
 * P3-01 — the pure half of semantic tool retrieval.
 *
 * `tool_search` has always ranked lexically ([ToolCatalog.matchAll]): a query matches a tool when
 * its characters appear in the name or the summary. That is exact, free, and blind the moment the
 * model describes a tool instead of naming it — which is the normal case for a user who writes in
 * Chinese, where the query shares no characters with `scrape_web` at all and the lexical scorer
 * returns nothing.
 *
 * This file adds the other channel: rank the same catalogue by embedding similarity, fuse the two
 * rankings, and decide which tools a turn should be handed before the model speaks. Everything
 * here is pure — no coroutines, no files, no Android — so the ranking contract is unit-testable on
 * a bare JVM, and the impure parts (loading the model, caching vectors) stay in
 * `me.rerere.rikkahub.data.vector.ToolVectorIndex`.
 *
 * ## Why ranks, and not scores
 *
 * EmbeddingGemma's cosine similarities are high and tightly bunched: on this app's own baseline
 * two *unrelated* passages reach 0.78. An absolute cutoff therefore cannot separate relevant from
 * irrelevant, and no amount of tuning makes one. Reciprocal rank fusion sidesteps that entirely by
 * combining the two *orderings* and never the numbers — which is the only thing those numbers are
 * trustworthy about. It also means the lexical scorer's 100/40/10/4/2 weights never have to be
 * commensurable with a cosine in the first place.
 *
 * ## Why fusing is safe for the behaviour we already have
 *
 * RRF only ever reorders. A tool whose name *is* the query still ranks first lexically and stays
 * at the top of the fused list, so the exact-match behaviour `tool_search` already had survives
 * unchanged; the vector channel can only promote tools the lexical channel never found.
