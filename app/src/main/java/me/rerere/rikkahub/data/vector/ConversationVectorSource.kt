/**
 * Conversation history as an indexed source.
 *
 * One document per message, keyed `<conversationId>|<messageId>`. The keyword index this replaces
 * (an FTS5 table) made the same choice, for the same reason: history search answers "where did we
 * say this", and an answer that names a conversation but not the message is only half an answer.
 * A message may still be *several chunks* - it can be long, and no model's window is - so the
 * document key is the message while the chunks are the message's paragraphs.
 *
 * Unlike the other sources this one is global rather than scoped: history search was never
 * per-assistant, and a user looking for what they discussed before does not care which assistant
 * it was with. There is therefore exactly one source key, and [sync]'s `scope` parameter is what
 * keeps a per-conversation sync from taking the rest of the history with it.
