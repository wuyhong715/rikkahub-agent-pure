 * multiply-adds, i.e. single-digit milliseconds with the vectors in memory, which is well below
 * the cost of the embedding call that produced the query. An approximate-nearest-neighbour
 * structure would add a build step, a recall/latency trade-off to tune, and a persistence
 * format of its own, to save a millisecond. Revisit at a hundred thousand chunks, not before.
 *
 * ## Why there is no absolute score threshold
 *
 * Embedding models do not share a similarity scale. Measured on EmbeddingGemma 2, two unrelated
 * sentences ("the cat sat on the mat" / "quarterly tax filing deadlines") still score 0.56, and
 * an unrelated noun pair ("猫" / "汽车发动机") scores 0.78 - so any hand-picked constant like
 * "keep hits above 0.8" is a fact about one model's output distribution, not about relevance.
 * The knob here is therefore *relative to the best hit in this very query*
 * ([relativeFloor]), which means the same number keeps working when the model is swapped.
 *
 * Pure, so the ranking policy is unit-tested rather than argued about.
