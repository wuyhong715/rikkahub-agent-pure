/**
 * The vector index, in its own database file.
 *
 * Separate from `rikka_hub.db` for the same reason the usage ledger is: the index is a **derived
 * cache** - every row in it can be recomputed from a document plus a model - and the main
 * database's upgrade path is load-bearing user data guarded by `ImportedDatabaseReconciler`'s
 * pinned identity hash and hand-written DDL. Adding a cache to that path buys nothing and risks
 * exactly the class of bug (#105) that reconciler exists to prevent.
 *
 * The separation also makes the lifecycle honest: forgetting the index is `delete the file`, and
 * a schema change is "bump [VERSION] and rebuild", because nothing here is user-authored.
 * `exportSchema = false` for the same reason - there is no migration contract to publish.
 *
 * A consequence worth stating: SQL cannot join across the two files, so anything that needs both
 * a chunk and its document joins in memory. That is acceptable because the join is always
 * one-directional (a hit names a document; the document is then fetched by key).
