/**
 * A stable 64-bit fingerprint of a piece of text.
 *
 * Deliberately not `String.hashCode()`: that is only specified to be *consistent within one
 * run of one JVM implementation*, so the same document could hash differently on the next app
 * version and the whole index would silently re-embed itself. FNV-1a is written out here in
 * ten lines rather than pulled in as a dependency because the property that matters is
 * "identical forever, identical on every platform", and every general-purpose hasher in the
 * ecosystem comes with a question mark over exactly that.
 *
 * Collisions are not a correctness risk here: a colliding pair means one unchanged document
 * is skipped when it should have been re-embedded. The next edit to either document fixes
 * that, and nothing is ever lost - the index is a derived cache.
