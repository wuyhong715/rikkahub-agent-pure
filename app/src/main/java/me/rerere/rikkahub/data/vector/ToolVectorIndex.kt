/**
 * P3-02 — the impure half of semantic tool retrieval: hold a vector per catalogue entry, produce
 * the missing ones, and hand the ranked names back.
 *
 * Everything decidable without a model lives in [ToolRankFusion] (ranking, fusion, selection) and
 * [ToolVectorCacheRules] (identity, staleness); this class is the part that has to load a model,
 * survive concurrency and be cancellable. Keeping the split there is what lets the ranking
 * contract be tested on a bare JVM, which is where retrieval bugs actually live.
 *
 * ## The one rule that matters at call time
 *
 * **A search waits for the catalogue to be embedded, but only briefly.** [answer] gives the vectors
 * [READY_WAIT_MS] to arrive, then reports [ToolSearchAnswer.Unavailable] rather than a ranking it
 * does not have. The old behaviour — answer lexically instead — is gone with the rest of this
 * product line's keyword paths: a keyword pass is not a smaller version of this feature, it is a
 * different one that returns nothing at all for a query written in Chinese. Once the model is
 * loaded a few hundred short strings embed well inside the budget, and a warm catalogue does not
 * wait at all.
 *
 * Vectors are held in memory only. They are derivable from (model, name, text), the catalogue is
 * small and changes with the MCP connections rather than with the conversation, and a persisted
 * copy would need the same invalidation story as the memory index for a fraction of the payoff.
