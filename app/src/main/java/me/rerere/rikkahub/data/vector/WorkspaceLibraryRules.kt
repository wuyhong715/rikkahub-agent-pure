/**
 * What the file library is allowed to contain, and how much of it one round may read.
 *
 * Moxw - the library is a directory in the workspace that the user points at, and the index reads
 * it recursively. Both halves of that sentence are why this object exists: a workspace can hold
 * anything (the one this was built against holds two repository clones, a gradle cache and a pile
 * of jars), so the walk needs an allow-list rather than a deny-list, and reading it can cost
 * minutes of embedding, so one round needs a budget.
 *
 * The allow-list is by extension. That is a deliberate simplification: it means every file the
 * index touches is one whose text we can actually read, and it makes "why is this file missing"
 * answerable by looking at one set. A deny-list would have to enumerate binaries, and would get
 * the next one wrong.
 *
 * Images are the one kind whose text is not *in* the file: it is read out of them by on-device text
 * recognition, so a screenshot of a stack trace is searchable by the words in it. That is also why
 * they carry numbers of their own - see [ESTIMATED_CHARS_PER_IMAGE] and [MAX_IMAGES_PER_ROUND].
