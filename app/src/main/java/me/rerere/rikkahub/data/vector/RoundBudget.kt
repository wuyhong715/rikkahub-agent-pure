/**
 * How much of an indexable collection one round may read, and which documents a round may forget.
 *
 * Two features now need the same two rules - the file library (P4) and conversation history (P5) -
 * and both of them are the kind of rule that fails silently and expensively:
 *
 *  - a round that ignores its budget embeds for an hour on a phone;
 *  - a round that treats "not read this round" as "deleted" deletes the previous round's work, so
 *    the index can never hold more than one round.
 *
 * Neither failure raises anything. The first is slow, the second looks like "search is bad". So the
 * rules live in one place, generic over what a document is, with tests, rather than being written
 * twice from the same memory.
